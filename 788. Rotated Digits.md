<h1>788. Rotated Digits</h1>

<h4>Description:</h4>
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.

Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?

```
input:
10

output:
4

Explanatin:
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
```

<h4>My Code:</h4>

```c
#define SAME 0 // 0, 1, 8
#define VALID 1 // 2, 6, 8, 9
#define INVALID 2 // 3, 4, 7

int rotatedDigits(int n) {
    int i, num, count = 0, is_valid[] = {SAME, SAME, VALID, INVALID, INVALID, VALID, VALID, INVALID, SAME, VALID};
    bool found = false;
    
    for(i = 2; i <= n; i++){
        num = i; found = false;
        while(num){
           if(is_valid[num % 10] == INVALID) {found = false; break;}
           if(is_valid[num % 10] == VALID) found = true; 
           num = num/10;
        }
        if(found == true) count++;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```
