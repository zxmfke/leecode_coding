# 237.Delete Node in a Linked List

### Description:

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become 1 -> 2 -> 4 after calling your function.

```
input:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4   3

output:
1 -> 2 -> 4
```

### My Code:</h4>

```c
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */
void deleteNode(struct ListNode* node) {
    node->val = node->next->val;
    node->next = node->next->next;
}
```
