<h1>621. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I</h1>

<h4>description:</h4>
Given a group of two strings, you need to find the longest uncommon subsequence of this group of two strings. 
The longest uncommon subsequence is defined as the longest subsequence of one of these strings and this subsequence should not be any subsequence of the other strings.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
Trivially, any string is a subsequence of itself and an empty string is a subsequence of any string.
The input will be two strings, and the output needs to be the length of the longest uncommon subsequence. 
If the longest uncommon subsequence doesn't exist, return -1.


```
Input:
Example 1:
"aba", "cdc"

Example 2:
"aba", "aba"

Output:
Example 1:
3

Example 2:
-1
```


<h4>My Code:</h4>

```c
int findLUSlength(char* a, char* b) {
    if(!strcmp(a,b))return -1;
    return strlen(a)>strlen(b)?strlen(a):strlen(b);
}
```

<h4>Code better than me:</h4>

```c
int findLUSlength(char* a, char* b) {
    if(strcmp(a,b)==0)
    {
        return -1;
    }
    else
    {
        if(strlen(a)>strlen(b))
        {
            return strlen(a);
        }
        else
        {
            return strlen(b);
        }
    }
}
```

<h4>Compare:</h4>
The code better than me is the performance. I don't know is it about the ternary operator.

<h4>self-examination:</h4>
It's easy to use the function in C library to program, but what's more important is that you need to know what if there is a situation
you cannot use those functions. So what I want to say is you have to read the souce code and the basic idea of those functions in C library.
You don't need to read them all, just some common functions.
