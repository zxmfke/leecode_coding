<h1>191. Number of 1 Bits</h1>

<h4>description:</h4>

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

```
Input:
10

Output:
2
```

<h4>My code:</h4>

```c
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
    int bit = 32;
    int result = 0;
    while(bit--)
    {
        if(((n%2)&1))result++;
        n/=2;
    }
    return result;
}
```


<h4>Code better than me:</h4>

```c
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n)
{
    int wgt = 0;
    while(n)
    {
        wgt += n&1;
        n>>=1;
    }
    return wgt;
}
```


<h4>Compare:</h4>
'>>' get used to the binary view, the number stores in computer is binary, so it easy to use this operator to compute.


<h4>knowledge:</h4>
uint32_t 


<h4>self-examination:</h4>
You are short of the view of binary.
