<h1>657. Judge Route Circle</h1>

<h4>Description:</h4>
Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). 
Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.
The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. 
The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). 
The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

```
Input:
Example 1:
"UD"

Example 2:
"LL"

Output:
Example 1:
True

Example 2:
false
```   


<h4>My Code:</h4>

```c
bool judgeCircle(char* moves) {
    
    int robotPosition[]={0,0};
    
    int i = strlen(moves)-1;
    for(;i>=0;i--)
    {
        switch(moves[i]){
            case 'U':{
                robotPosition[1]+=1;
                break;
            }
            case 'D':{
                robotPosition[1]-=1;
                break;
            }
            case 'R':{
                robotPosition[0]+=1;
                break;
            }
            case 'L':{
                robotPosition[0]-=1;
                break;
            }
            default :{
                break;
            } 
        }
    }
    
    if(robotPosition[0]==0 && robotPosition[1]==0)return true;
    else return false;
}
```


<h4>Code better than me:</h4>

```c
bool judgeCircle(char *moves) 
{
    int array[26] = {0};
    while(*moves) {
        array[*(moves++) - 'A']++;
    }

    return ( (array[20] == array[3]) && (array[11] == array[17]) );
}
```


<h4>compare:</h4>
Using memory to save time.
This idea is the basic idea of question. Actually you don't need to compute how your robot moves, you just need to figure is it
equivalent in each direction out.

<h4>knowledge:</h4>
no.

<h4>self-examition:</h4>
The view of position, you can map to matrix.
